# Mario Game with Pure JavaScript

## Purpose

Mario Game is a simple game using pure JavaScript ES6. It's a go-to solution for quickly creating modern canvas pieces using ES6 and webpack.

## Getting Started

1.  Clone the repo:

        git clone https://github.com/valiantcreative33/mario-game.git

2.  Install dependencies:

        yarn

    or

        npm install

3.  Run webpack:

        npm start

Your new Mario Game should open up automatically at http://localhost:3000 and you should see 'Mario Game' on hover.
